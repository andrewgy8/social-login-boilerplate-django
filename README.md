## Django Social Login Boilerplate

This boiler plate will get you up and running with social logins.

Github login is enabled by default.  

## Features	 
 --------	 
 * User Registration	 
 * Django Tests	 
 * Basic Authentication with username and password
 
 
 This uses [django-social-auth](https://github.com/omab/django-social-auth), therefore you may use authorization 
 from any service of which that library supports.
